# Starter Cookie
A lightweight cookiecutter template for data science projects using poetry, inspired by the awesome [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) Project.

## Prerequisites
In order to use this template, you **need** to have the following packages installed on your system:

- Python
- poetry
- cookiecutter
- DVC (if you wan't to use the functionality)

optional:
- Pyenv (for managing different python versions)
- pipx (to install poetry & cookecutter in an isolated way)

## Installation 
To use the cookie you need to run the following command in your [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)/ cmd:
```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/Fa-bi-an/starter-cookie.git
```
This command downloads the cookie and starts the setup assistant.

## Usage
### pyenv
After installing and configuring the cookie you are now able to create the virtual envionment using poetry. If you're using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-local) make sure to have the same version of python selected as `local` as you picked while using the setup assistant.

### poetry

```bash
poetry shell
```
After creating an virtual project environment, you can now install the predefined packages:

```bash
poetry install
```
## Optional configuration
Using this cookie and enabeling the options via the setup assistant you can make use of optional components.

### optional: install pre-commit git hooks
Activate the [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#3-install-the-git-hook-scripts) by running the following command once:
```bash pre-commit install

```

### optional: DVC
If you are using DVC, don't forget to [add a remote storage](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/remote#example-add-a-default-local-remote).



## Your good to go!
In the notebooks directory you will find a starter notebook. For installing further packages from pypi just run `poetry add <package>`. For more information how to use poetry hava a look in the [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/).
